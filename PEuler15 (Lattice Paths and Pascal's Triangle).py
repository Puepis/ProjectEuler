   "How many routes are there through a 20ï¿½20 grid? (only restricted to right
   and down movements)"

   Lattice Paths -- Shortest Path Diagrams

   The number of possible paths of length 2n from a corner of an
   n-by-n grid to the opposite corner (central binomial coefficients - think
   Pascal's triangle)
