# ProjectEuler
This respository contains all of my ProjectEuler solutions. 

### What's Project Euler?
Project Euler is a series of difficult problems that require both mathematical insights and programming skills to solve. To learn more about Project Euler, visit their [website](https://projecteuler.net/) and create an account to get started solving problems!

## Languages
My solutions are all coded in Python, but I am looking to expand my repertoire and use other languages as well.

## Remarks
Project Euler problems are challenges that I love to pursue in my spare time, and they allow me to learn a lot about both Mathematics and programming. My solutions are certainly not the most *elegant* nor the most *efficient*, but I hope to revisit the problems that I have already finished to improve my previous work.
